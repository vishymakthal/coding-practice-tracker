# coding-practice-tracker
Script that reads a spreadsheet of coding problems and sets reminders for doing them. Unfortunately it doesn't do the problems as well.

## Overview

During college, unless I was cramming a few days or so before an interview, I would not be practicing coding/interview questions.
This proved to be a bad approach (who would have thought) as I didn't have enough time to digest the breadth of topics out there,
nor did I maintain a working knowledge of data structures and algorithms beyond the recruiting season. 

This coding practice tracker is my attempt to combat the issue of not keeping in practice. The tracker reads a spreadsheet that contains a list of problems,
the date I first solved them, and the subsequent dates to review them. Whenever it's the review date for a problem, I'm reminded to do it again.

## In Action

Here's an example of a few problems with initial solved dates. The review dates are automatically populated in the spreadsheet.

And here's an example of a reminder that gets placed on my calendar on a review day.
